# It is common practice to make all of a class's data attributes private and to provide methods for accessing and changing those attributes
# A method that returns a value from a class's attribute but does not change it is known as an accessor method
# Note that get_manufact, get_model, and get_retail_price are alll accessor methods
# On the other hand, a method that stores a value in a data attribute or changes the value of a data attribute
# in some other way is known as a mutator method. These methods control the way that a class's data attributes are modified.
# set_manufac, set_model, and set_retail are mutator methods
# Note that mutator methods are sometimes called "setters" and accessor methods are sometimes called "getters"
