This is my primary Git repository for Python based programs. The repository is named after Pythagoras. While much remains mysterious about his work and life, Pythagoras arguably made influential contributions to philosophy and religious teaching in the late 6th century BC. He is often revered as a great mathematician, ystic and scientist, but he is best known for the Pythagorean theorem which bears his name. However, because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than that of the other pre-Socratic philosophers, one can give only a tentative account of his teachings, and some have questioned whether he contributed much to mathematics and natural philosophy.
